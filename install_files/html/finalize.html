There seems to be a problem with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL">pretty urls</a> on your server and installer was not able to fix this issue automatically so regular site urls will not work and result in 404 error. This issue is usually caused by disabled mod_rewrite apache module or misconfigured virtual hosts on the server, you will most likely need to contact your hosting support regarding this issue.</span>
